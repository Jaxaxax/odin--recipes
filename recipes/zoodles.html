    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cherry tomatoes and quickly stir until tomatoes just begin to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add zucchini noodles, salt, and pepper. Keep cooking, stirring frequently, until zoodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in mozzarella and basil. Toss to coat. Divide zoodles between 4 bowls and drizzle with balsamic glaze. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tip: Zoodles do not reheat well and become watery the longer they sit. Eat immediately.</p>
